            Switch Statement
        </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
        In computer programming languages, a switch statement is a type of selection control mechanism used to allow the value of a variable or expression to change the control flow of program execution via search and map.
    </p>
    <p>
        Switch statements function somewhat similarly to the if statement used in programming languages like C/C++, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Java and exists in most high-level imperative programming languages such as Pascal, Ada, C/C++, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Java, and in many other types of language, using such keywords as switch, case, select or inspect.
    </p>

    <h3>

        Though many other languages offer switch statements, python does not have any switch statement. According to PEP-3103, it assure about the fact. However if you like switch case statement in other programming languages, you can create code snippet that works like a switch case statement in python.
